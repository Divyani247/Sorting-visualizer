# Sorting-visualizer
Sorting Visualizer is a web app for Visualiation of different sorting algorithms using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
Includes Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Quick sort, Merge sort.

Below, I am attaching a video to show how it looks.


## Features

- Speed button -> to increase or decrease sorting speed.
- Size button -> to increase or decrease size of array.
- New array -> to get new array for sorting.



## Languages used

HTML , CSS , JAVSCRIPT
## Lessons Learned
